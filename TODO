* API Keys:
  - Display "data for this key has not yet been pulled" instead of just NONE NONE NONE
  - Explain how API data is pulled
  - Some way to see last pull/next pull time for keys
  - Warn when a key doesn't have the required mask to pull AccountStatus (game time warnings)

* Account Management:
  - Move API Keys to this page
  - Move Event Log to this page
  - Add a way to create Campaigns
  - Clean up Skill Plans tab, kinda ugly
  - Skill Plans need to be renameable

* Assets:
  - Add a volume column
  - Improve search features:
    = Types:
      # Value
      # Total value
      # Containers only toggle?
      # Item group
      # Station name
      # System name
    = Magical JS buttons to add/remove extra search filters
  - Work out why the initial CharacterAsset view query is so slow, 1300 rows shouldn't take half a second. Possibly
    related to the pile of horrible LEFT OUTER JOINs, try querying (items, characters, etc) separately and caching.
  - Database model:
    = Shift the primary key to an auto-generated id field
    = Move id to asset_id and make it non-unique

* Blueprints:
  - Work out a way to be able to say "I want to make 100 Blackbirds and 300 rigs to go on them" and get a BPCalc
    summary page out of it.
  - Profitability dumping to buys instead of using sells?
  - Fix column sorting yet again

* BPCalc:
  - '% Volume' column is reflecting weekly volume, not <days> volume

* Character Sheet:
  - Make categories expandable/collapsible
  - Expand all/collapse all JavaScript links
  - Standings tab needs agent standings
  - Anonymous character sheet needs skill plan support
  - Ability to see a post-plan character sheet?

* Contracts:
  - Implement database models to store contracts and contract contents
  - Work out how in the hell to track them for Trade
  - Use Events for contract completion/expiry
  - Summary table similar to orders

* Home:
  - Fix several mobile browser bugs:
    = The body: padding-top CSS is not required on Android default browser at the very least
    = Links disappear completely on Android default browser
    = Home page does not do responsive things with at least theme-slate

* Market Scan:
  - Add different scan types (assets+blueprints takes forever):
    = Assets
    = Blueprints
    = [All]

* Skill Plans
  - Implement skill plan creation (hahahaha oh god)
    = Skill model needs to track pre-requisites
    = Use AJAX and modal windows for add/delete/re-order
    = Step 1: basic adding of skills with pre-requisites
    = Step 2: deletion of skills with pre-requisites and a useful "are you sure?" prompt
    = Step 3: re-ordering of entries
      # Basic updating - if you move position 32 to position 2, you can update that in two queries:
        % UPDATE thing_entry SET position = position + 1 WHERE skillplan_id = n AND (position >= 2 AND position <= 1)
        % UPDATE thing_entry SET position = 2 WHERE id = n
      # Complex updating - deal with pre-requisites, urgh
  - Needs to be a distinction between "publicly accessible for my character" and "globally accessible to everyone"
  - Plans need to be renameable

* Transactions:
  - Ability to search transactions via:
    = character
    = partial item name
    = date (before x, after x, between x and y)
    = wallets?
    = client
  - Clickable Client column to filter further

* Wallet journal:
  - Implement database model to store
  - ISK per hour graph for mission rewards/rat bounties/etc
  - Corporation graph too?

* api_updater:
  - Make SystemEvent objects for admin-related events
  - Wallet Journal char/corp support
  - Convert everything over to using Django 1.4 bulk saves
    = Standings, WalletTransactions done

* documentation:
  - Pages need to explain what the hell they do

* misc:
  - Get some less awful themes, oh dear
  - Email warnings
    = Let user configure email address (save to auth_user email field?)
      # Implement email verification because people are idiots
    = Configurable:
      # Frequency (once, hourly, daily)
        % Will need a new database model to store events that have been issued
      # Things to email about (insufficient clone, room in skill queue, account not in training, account time <10 days)

* price_updater:
  - Add support for other sources of market data
