* API Keys page:
  - minimum flags for basic functionality (skill plans, character sheets)
  - list of other flags and what features they enable
  - link to the API page with a minimum key flag set
  - "this key has not yet updated" or something instead of just NONE NONE NONE
  - explain how API data is pulled

* Character Sheet page:
  - Possibly start all categories collapsed with "Category - 5.3 million SP - 5.7%", expandable
  - Expand all/collapse all JavaScript links

* Assets page:
  - Corporate assets needs to be enabled and tested
  - Add a volume column
  - Improve search features:
    = Types: value, total value, containers only, group only
    = Magical JS buttons to add/remove extra search filters
  - Work out why the initial CharacterAsset view query is so slow, 1300 rows shouldn't take half a second. Possibly
    related to the pile of horrible LEFT OUTER JOINs, try querying (items, characters, etc) separately and caching.

* Account Settings page:
  - new page, add various account settings that don't exist right now
    = number of accounts per row on home page (2, 3, 4, 6)
    = theme selection (I assume people will want a dark theme)
  - combine API Keys into this page
  - combine Change Password into this page

* Blueprints page:
  - Work out a way to be able to say "I want to make 100 Blackbirds and 100 Railguns to go on them" and get a BPCalc
    page out of it.
  - Profitability dumping to buys instead of using sells?

* Multiple user accounts using keys for the same game account needs to work without weird things happening
* Total SP on Home page
* More prominent account expiry warnings on Home/API Keys pages
* Corporate assets needs to be enabled and tested

* Wallet journal:
  - ohgod
  - ISK per hour graph for mission rewards/rat bounties/etc
  - Corporation graph too?

* api_updater:
  - make SystemEventLog objects for start/finish with basic stats so I can maybe track performance issues easier

* Documentation:
  - pages need to explain what the hell they do
