* API Keys:
  - Display "data for this key has not yet been pulled" instead of just NONE NONE NONE
  - Explain how API data is pulled
  - Some way to see last pull/next pull time for keys
  - Warn when a key doesn't have the required mask to pull AccountStatus (game time warnings)
  - Explain that any corporation key requires you to also have an account/character key for the character or Bad
    Things happen.

* Account Settings page:
  - New page, add various account settings that don't exist right now
    = Number of accounts per row on home page (2, 3, 4, 6)
    = Theme selection (I assume people will want a dark theme)
  - Combine API Keys into this page
  - Combine Change Password into this page
  - Combine Event Log into this page

* Assets:
  - Add a volume column
  - Improve search features:
    = Types: value, total value, containers only, group only
    = Magical JS buttons to add/remove extra search filters
  - Work out why the initial CharacterAsset view query is so slow, 1300 rows shouldn't take half a second. Possibly
    related to the pile of horrible LEFT OUTER JOINs, try querying (items, characters, etc) separately and caching.
  - Pop-up box for ships with an EFT text block to copy into a fitting tool.
  - Database model:
    = Shift the primary key to an auto-generated id field
    = Move id to asset_id and make it non-unique

* Blueprints:
  - Work out a way to be able to say "I want to make 100 Blackbirds and 300 rigs to go on them" and get a BPCalc
    summary page out of it.
  - Profitability dumping to buys instead of using sells?

* Character Sheet:
  - Make categories expandable/collapsible
  - Expand all/collapse all JavaScript links
  - Standings tab with faction/corp/agent standings

* Market Scan:
  - Add different scan types:
    = Assets
    = Blueprints
    = [All]

* Transactions:
  - Improve pagination display, maybe << [1] 2 3 >> then << 1 [2] 3 >>, << 2 [3] 4 >> etc? Also needs to go at top
    and bottom of pages instead of just bottom.
  - Ability to search transactions via:
    = partial item name
    = date (before x, after x, between x and y)
    = wallets?
  - Track other party in the transaction, new table probably?

* Wallet journal:
  - Implement database model to store
  - ISK per hour graph for mission rewards/rat bounties/etc
  - Corporation graph too?

* api_updater:
  - Make SystemEvent objects for admin-related events
  - Standings support
  - Wallet Journal char/corp support
  - Convert everything over to using Django 1.4 bulk saves

* documentation:
  - Pages need to explain what the hell they do

* misc:
  - Multiple user accounts using keys for the same game account needs to work without weird things happening
  - Replace Django templating engine with Jinja2 for speedups
  - Get some less awful themes, oh dear

* price_updater:
  - Add support for other sources of market data
