* API Keys page:
  - minimum flags for basic functionality (skill plans, character sheets)
  - list of other flags and what features they enable
  - link to the API page with a minimum key flag set
  - "this key has not yet updated" or something instead of just NONE NONE NONE
  - explain how API data is pulled

* Character Sheet page:
  - Possibly start all categories collapsed with "Category - 5.3 million SP - 5.7%", expandable
  - Expand all/collapse all JavaScript links
  - 256x256 spy image for anonymous character pages


* Fix Blueprints page not having a working delete button
* Multiple user accounts using keys for the same game account needs to work without weird things happening
* Total SP on Home page
* More prominent account expiry warnings on Home/API Keys pages
* Corporate assets needs to be enabled and tested

* api_updater:
  - quick fix: don't do processing for calls that succeeded with no warnings, duh
  - long fix: rewrite to use some sort of worker backend (Celery+RabbitMQ?)

* Documentation:
  - pages need to explain what the hell they do
